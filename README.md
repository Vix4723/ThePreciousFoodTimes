## The Precious Food Times Website

This website was created for the MLH Local Hack Day: Build 2021 Hackathon. I did not have as much time as I wanted but here is what I got. Hope you like it.

#The objective of the daily challenge is to build something to reduce food waste, here is the prompt of the assignment: 
"One of our favorite hacks to see built are recipe databases, smart refrigerators, and grocery list creators. We think these projects are common to see at hackathons because theyâ€™re genuinely useful for the world. Create one of these, or any other hack that works to reduce food waste."

Therefore, I decided to create a website to display the different types of food and sustainable companies that promote our global food sustainability.
